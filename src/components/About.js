                    I was born in Bore,Guji,Oromia. I learned everything I needed to know there. Everything that has to do with life that is. I started my education there. My educational background was just as normal and fun like any other kids. But I was the unique child

                My family is well diversified. Every family member plays an important role in all my familyâ€™s lives. In my family, there are 10 people: my father, my mother, my 2 brotherd and my 5 sistors My father is one who brings money home and is also responsible for organizing and planning family trips. My mother is the one who is in charge for making meals and makes sure everyone eats at the appropriate times.

                In my spare time, I love taking pictures. I have even documented many university events as part of my artistic practice. Working hand in hand with others has surely stood out to me as a passion in my life. I enjoy collaborating with others, artistically through photography and most certainly, through mentorship. I look forward to continuing to develop these skills and passions through this opportunity.
